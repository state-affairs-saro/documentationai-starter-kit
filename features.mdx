## Projects and organization

Projects are the primary way to organize related work items within a workspace.

- Group documents, folders, and related resources into a single project
- Use consistent naming to keep work easy to find
- Archive or close projects when work is complete
- Keep sensitive work in separate projects with appropriate access

Projects are especially useful when different teams or time-bound efforts need clear boundaries.

## Documents and folders

Documents hold the content you work on in State Affairs, and folders help you structure that content.

- Create and edit documents within a project
- Organize documents into folders and subfolders
- Use meaningful titles and folder names for easier navigation
- Move documents and folders as your project structure evolves

If you cannot see a document you expect to have access to, see [Cannot View Documents](/help-center/troubleshooting/cannot-view-documents) for troubleshooting steps, including checking your account and refreshing your workspace.

## Permissions and access control

Permissions determine who can view or modify workspaces, projects, and documents.

- Access is based on your account and workspace membership
- Project- or folder-level restrictions may limit what you can see
- Some content may be read-only, while other content allows editing
- Changes to your role or membership can affect your visibility

<Callout kind="tip">

If you see an "Access Denied" message or a document appears to be missing, first confirm you are signed in with the correct account and in the right workspace, then contact your administrator if the issue persists. You can also review [Cannot View Documents](/help-center/troubleshooting/cannot-view-documents) for additional checks.
