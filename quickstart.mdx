</Callout>

### Step 2: Verify your state access

Your access depends on your plan and how your organization is configured.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Identify your primary state or states" icon="map">

  - If you are a **News Customer**, you should see content for your single covered state.
  - If you are on the **Platform** plan, you should see access to one or more states tied to your subscription.
  - If you are an **Enterprise** customer, you should be able to move between multiple or all 50 states.

  Use the navigation in the product to:

  - Confirm which state or states you can view
  - Switch between states if your plan includes more than one

  </Step>

  <Step title="Check that content is loading as expected" icon="check-circle">

  On your first state view, confirm that you can see:

  - Recent news and updates for that state
  - Any policy or legislative information your plan includes
  - Basic navigation to move between news, policy intel, and any tools available to you

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout kind="info">

If you believe your plan should include additional states or features you do not see, your billing or admin contact can review your subscription in the [Self-Service Portal](/help-center/guides/self-service-portal) and related guides, or contact State Affairs support.

</Callout>

### Step 3: Confirm your role and permissions

Your organization may have multiple users with different roles.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Understand what you should be able to do" icon="users">

  Depending on your responsibilities, you might:

  - Primarily read news and policy updates
  - Monitor specific topics, committees, or offices
  - Manage alerts or tracked items for your team
  - Configure or review billing and seat assignments

  </Step>

  <Step title="Validate access against your responsibilities" icon="shield">

  - If you manage billing or seats, confirm you can reach the Self-Service Portal from your account.
  - If you lead policy monitoring, confirm you can search, filter, and follow the topics or entities you care about.
  - If you are a read-only user, confirm you can access all relevant states and sections you need to monitor.

  </Step>
</Steps>

For help with account-level access and roles, see [Access & Credentials](/help-center/guides/access-credentials).

## News Customer quickstart

This section is for **News Customers**: you pay for non-partisan statehouse news coverage in a single state.

Your first session goal is to:

- Confirm you are seeing the correct statehouse coverage
- Start following the topics, people, or institutions that matter most to you
- Set up a simple monitoring routine

### Step 1: Confirm your statehouse news view

<Steps>
  <Step title="Locate your state news home" icon="home">

  After signing in, navigate to the main news view for your covered state. This view typically emphasizes:

  - Statehouse news and analysis
  - Key political and policy developments
  - Ongoing coverage of the governor, legislature, and major agencies

  </Step>

  <Step title="Scan recent coverage" icon="book-open">

  Spend a few minutes scanning:

  - The most recent headlines and stories
  - Any featured or in-depth pieces
  - Sections that align with your work (for example, specific policy areas, institutions, or offices)

  This gives you a baseline sense of how State Affairs covers your state.

  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Focus on your topics and beats

<Steps>
  <Step title="Search for your core topics" icon="search">

  Use the search or filtering options in the news experience to look for:

  - Your organization
  - Key agencies, committees, or offices you track
  - Core policy topics (such as education, transportation, or health)

  Confirm that you can quickly find recent and relevant coverage.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Identify recurring reporters and sections" icon="users">

  As you review search results and sections, note:

  - Which reporters or columns regularly cover your areas of interest
  - Which sections you are likely to check most often

  This helps you build a repeatable reading pattern.

  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 3: Establish a simple monitoring habit

<Steps>
  <Step title="Decide on your check-in cadence" icon="clock">

  Based on your workload and responsibilities, choose how often you will:

  - Open State Affairs to review new stories
  - Scan for mentions of your organization or priorities
  - Share relevant coverage with internal stakeholders

  </Step>

  <Step title="Optionally coordinate with your team" icon="users">

  If multiple people at your organization read State Affairs:

  - Decide who focuses on which topics
  - Agree on how you will share key pieces internally
  - Align on what counts as a "must-read" for leadership

  </Step>
</Steps>

If you later add policy intel or multi-state coverage, you can return to this quickstart and follow the Platform or Enterprise sections.

## Platform quickstart (Pro + News)

This section is for **Platform (Pro + News)** customers: you pay for news plus policy intel such as bills, hearings, schedules, and directories.

Your first session goal is to:

- Confirm access to both news and policy intel for your covered state or states
- Start tracking a small set of high-priority issues
- Make it easier to know what to watch each week

### Step 1: Move between news and policy intel

<Steps>
  <Step title="Verify your news coverage" icon="book-open">

  As in the News Customer quickstart, confirm you can:

  - View your statehouse news home
  - Search for key topics, people, and institutions
  - Identify the sections most relevant to your work

  </Step>

  <Step title="Locate policy intel features" icon="database">

  From your main view, use the product navigation to find areas dedicated to:

  - Bills and legislation
  - Hearings and events
  - Calendars or schedules
  - Directories of offices, legislators, or staff

  You do not need to explore everything immediately. Start by confirming that these sections load and correspond to your state or states.

  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Track a small set of issues

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose 3–5 core issues to monitor" icon="target">

  With your team or on your own, decide which issues matter most in the near term. For example:

  - A specific bill or package
  - A committee or agency you watch closely
  - A policy area such as tax, energy, or healthcare

  </Step>

  <Step title="Use search and filters to locate activity" icon="search">

  For each issue, use search and filtering tools in the policy intel sections to:

  - Find related bills and legislative actions
  - Identify relevant hearings or upcoming events
  - See which offices or legislators are most involved

  </Step>

  <Step title="Optional: Mark or follow key items" icon="star">

  If your plan and configuration support it, use any available options to:

  - Mark important bills or entities
  - Save or follow items for quick access later
  - Organize a short list of what you need to watch this week

  Focus on a small number of high-impact items so the signal remains clear.

  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 3: Align news and policy views

<Steps>
  <Step title="Compare policy activity with coverage" icon="zap">

  Take one of your tracked issues and:

  - Look at recent or upcoming legislative activity in the policy intel sections.
  - Search the news view for coverage of the same bills, committees, or themes.

  This helps you see how State Affairs connects inside-the-building activity to public-facing coverage.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Decide how you will share insights" icon="users">

  Agree on how you will:

  - Flag important developments to internal stakeholders
  - Use both news and policy intel when you brief colleagues or leadership
  - Capture questions that may require deeper research or follow-up

  </Step>
</Steps>

As your team gets comfortable, you can expand to more issues, committees, or states within your subscription.

## Enterprise quickstart

This section is for **Enterprise** customers: you have a Platform-like experience across all 50 states, plus AI-enabled tools designed to find policy signal through noise.

Your first session goal is to:

- Confirm your multi-state access
- Use AI-enabled features to surface signal on a small set of cross-state priorities
- Set up a basic workflow so you are not overwhelmed by volume

### Step 1: Confirm multi-state coverage

<Steps>
  <Step title="Move between multiple states" icon="globe">

  Use the product navigation to:

  - Switch among several states you care about most
  - Confirm you can see both news and policy intel for each state
  - Verify that the content is current and clearly labeled by state

  </Step>

  <Step title="Identify your priority states" icon="map">

  Decide which states are most important for your first week. For example:

  - States where you are active this session
  - States where key policy trends are emerging
  - States where you need to brief leadership soon

  Focus on a small set first so you can build a repeatable pattern.

  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Use AI-enabled tools to find signal

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start from a concrete policy question" icon="help-circle">

  Before using AI features, write down a short, specific question such as:

  - How is a particular policy being handled across several states?
  - Which bills across multiple states touch a certain topic or industry?
  - Where should we focus attention this week on a given issue?

  A focused question makes it easier to evaluate the quality of results.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Apply AI tools to your question" icon="zap">

  Use the AI-enabled capabilities in your Enterprise experience to:

  - Aggregate related news and policy activity across multiple states
  - Highlight which bills, hearings, or actors matter most for your question
  - Reduce repetitive manual searching for similar topics in each jurisdiction

  Pay attention to how the tools explain why particular items are surfaced. This helps you decide how much follow-up review you need.

  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 3: Build a cross-state monitoring workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define your core watch list" icon="list">

  Based on your first AI-assisted exploration, define:

  - A short list of cross-state issues you will actively monitor
  - Which states you will prioritize for each issue
  - How often you need updates (for example, daily, weekly, or at key calendar moments)

  </Step>

  <Step title="Decide what you will review manually" icon="settings">

  AI tools help reduce noise, but manual review remains important. Decide:

  - Which high-stakes items you will still review directly in the underlying news or policy intel views
  - How you will document or share the key findings with your team
  - When you will revisit your watch list to add or remove topics

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout kind="tip">

Enterprise customers often benefit from a short internal guide that lists core questions, priority states, and how your team expects to use AI summaries versus direct source review. Consider drafting and sharing such a guide within your organization.
