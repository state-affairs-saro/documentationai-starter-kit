</Callout>

## Step 2: Create or access a project

Your main workspace in State Affairs is organized into projects. Each project can contain multiple documents, grouped into folders.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find an existing project" icon="folder">

  On the dashboard, use the project list to:

  - Scan for the project name you need
  - Open a project by clicking its name

  This opens the project workspace where you can view and edit documents, depending on your access level.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a new project (if allowed)" icon="plus">

  If your permissions allow project creation, you should see an option on the dashboard such as **New project** or a similar control.

  1. Click the new project control.
  2. Enter a clear project name that matches your team or initiative.
  3. Confirm to create the project.

  You will be taken into the empty project workspace, ready to add documents.

  </Step>
</Steps>

For more guidance on planning and structuring projects, see [Organizing Projects](/help-center/guides/organizing-projects).

## Step 3: Add your first document

Within a project, documents capture the actual content your team needs to read and maintain.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the documents area" icon="file-text">

  In your chosen project, navigate to the documents area. This is typically presented as a list or tree of documents and folders in the project workspace.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a document" icon="plus">

  1. Look for a control such as **New document** or **Add document** in the documents area.
  2. Click it to create a new, empty document.
  3. Give the document a descriptive title so teammates can recognize it from the list.
  4. Add your initial content and save.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Edit and refine content" icon="edit">

  After the document is created, you can:

  - Reopen it from the project documents list
  - Update text, headings, and other content
  - Save changes so they are available to other users with access to the project

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout kind="info">

The exact labels for buttons and controls can vary slightly by account configuration, but the flow remains: open a project, then create or edit a document from the project workspace.

</Callout>

## Step 4: Organize documents with folders

As projects grow, folders help keep documents easy to browse and maintain.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a folder" icon="folder">

  Inside the project documents area:

  1. Look for an option such as **New folder** or **Add folder**.
  2. Click it to create a folder.
  3. Name the folder based on a logical grouping, such as a team, feature, or topic.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Move documents into folders" icon="arrow-right">

  Once you have folders:

  - Use the project interface to move existing documents into the appropriate folders.
  - When creating new documents, select the folder where they should live (if the option is available during creation).

  Over time, this structure makes it easier for your team to find and maintain content.

  </Step>
</Steps>
