## How to Check Which Subscriptions You Have

### Red Flags You Might Have Multiple Subscriptions:

1. **You're charged more than once per month**
   - Check your credit card or bank statements
   - Look for multiple charges from State Affairs

2. **You receive more newspapers than you expect**
   - Are you getting 2 or more copies delivered?
   - This often indicates multiple print subscriptions

3. **Your charges don't match what you remember signing up for**
   - Expected $28/month but being charged $56?
   - That's likely two subscriptions

4. **You have subscriptions under different email addresses**
   - Check if you signed up with work email AND personal email
   - Each creates a separate subscription

### To Verify Your Subscriptions:

**Option 1: Check Your Email**
- Search your inbox for "State Affairs" + "invoice"
- Count how many DIFFERENT subscription invoices you receive each month
- Look at the invoice details - each will show subscription type

**Option 2: Contact Support**
Email: billing@stateaffairs.com

Include in your email:
- Your organization name
- All email addresses that might be associated with accounts
- Your question: "Can you tell me how many active subscriptions I have?"

**We'll reply within 24 hours with:**
- Complete list of your active subscriptions
- What each subscription includes
- Monthly cost of each
- Suggestion on which to keep

## Common Scenarios & Solutions

### Scenario 1: "I thought I only had one subscription, but I'm charged twice"

**What Probably Happened:**
- You may have signed up for Print+Digital AND Digital-Only
- Or someone else at your organization created a second subscription
- Or you have one subscription for each of multiple publications

**Solution:**
1. Contact billing@stateaffairs.com
2. Request a complete subscription list
3. Decide which subscription(s) to keep
4. We'll cancel the others and prevent future billing

**Important:** We'll write off any outstanding balance for cancelled subscriptions. Previously collected payments are non-refundable, but you won't be charged going forward.

---

### Scenario 2: "I'm receiving two newspapers but only want one"

**What Probably Happened:**
- You have two Print+Digital subscriptions
- OR you have a Print-Only AND a Print+Digital subscription
- Each one sends you a physical copy

**Solution:**
1. Email support@stateaffairs.com with:
   - Your mailing address
   - How many copies you're receiving
   - How many you actually need
2. We'll identify the duplicate subscriptions
3. We'll cancel the extras
4. We'll contact the printer to stop duplicate deliveries

**Timeline:** It may take 1-2 billing cycles for delivery to fully stop due to print schedules.

---

### Scenario 3: "I have subscriptions for multiple people at my organization"

**This is Normal!** Many organizations have subscriptions for:
- Different team members
- Different departments
- Different office locations

**What You Need to Know:**
- Each subscription is independent
- Each has its own login credentials
- Each is billed separately (unless you have a group plan)

**To Manage Multiple Users:**
- Consider a group/enterprise plan for better pricing
- Contact your account representative
- We can consolidate billing while keeping separate access

---

### Scenario 4: "I cancelled my subscription but was still charged"

**What Probably Happened:**
- The cancellation wasn't processed before the next billing cycle
- You cancelled ONE subscription but have another active
- Your cancellation email wasn't received

**Solution:**
1. Forward your cancellation confirmation (if you have one) to billing@stateaffairs.com
2. Include details about the charge
3. We'll:
   - Verify the cancellation status
   - Process immediate cancellation if needed
   - Refund or credit the charge if appropriate

## Understanding Your Invoice

### What to Look For:

**1. Invoice Number**
- Unique identifier for each bill
- Format: Year + Number (e.g., 2025067432)

**2. Service Period**
- Shows exactly what dates you're being charged for
- Example: "Jun. 19, 2025 - Jul. 18, 2025"

**3. Subscription Type**
- States whether it's Print, Digital, or Print+Digital
- If not clearly stated, contact billing for clarification

**4. Amount**
- Should match your subscription tier
- Changes may occur due to annual price increases or subscription changes

### Red Flags on Your Invoice:

⚠️ **Multiple invoices in one day**
- May indicate multiple active subscriptions
- Review carefully

⚠️ **Unexpected amount**
- Higher than usual charges could mean:
  - Multiple subscriptions
  - Catch-up billing for missed payments
  - Price increase (you should have been notified)

⚠️ **Service periods that don't match**
- If you're being charged for overlapping periods, contact us

⚠️ **Invoices for publications you don't subscribe to**
- May be public notice invoices (one-time charges)
- Or another subscription you weren't aware of

## Autopay & Subscription Management

### How Autopay Works:

1. You provide payment information
2. Your card is charged automatically each billing period
3. You receive an invoice email for your records
4. Repeat monthly

### Benefits of Autopay:
- Never miss a payment
- Uninterrupted service
- Convenience

### Potential Issues:
- If you have multiple subscriptions, ALL charge automatically
- System migrations can cause catch-up charges for missed payments
- Card expirations cause failed payments

### Managing Autopay:

**To Update Payment Method:**
- Email billing@stateaffairs.com
- We'll guide you through secure payment update process
- Never email credit card details

**To Disable Autopay:**
- Email billing@stateaffairs.com with your request
- You'll receive manual invoices to pay each month
- Risk of service interruption if invoices aren't paid promptly

**Caught Up by Surprise Charges?**
- This sometimes happens after system migrations
- Contact billing@stateaffairs.com immediately
- We can review charges and set up payment plans if needed

## Public Notice Billing vs. Subscription Billing

### What are Public Notices?

Public notices are legal advertisements that organizations must publish. These are separate from subscriptions.

**Examples:**
- Legal proceedings
- Government announcements
- Public meeting notices
- Bidding opportunities

### Why You Received a Public Notice Invoice:

If you requested publication of a public notice, you'll receive a separate invoice for that service. This is:
- **One-time billing** (not recurring)
- **Different from your subscription fee**
- **Sent to the organization requesting publication**

### How to Tell the Difference:

**Subscription Invoice:**
- Monthly recurring charge
- Shows service period (e.g., Jan 1-31)
- Lists subscription type
- Same amount each month (usually)

**Public Notice Invoice:**
- One-time charge
- References specific publication date
- Includes notice details
- Variable amount based on size/placement
