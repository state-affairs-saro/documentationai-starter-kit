# Understanding Multiple Charges

# Why Was I Charged Multiple Times? Understanding Unexpected Charges

## Overview

If you see multiple charges from State Affairs on your credit card or bank statement, you're not alone. This is one of the most common questions we receive. This guide explains the most common reasons and how to resolve them.

---

## Top Reasons for Multiple Charges

### 1. You Have Multiple Active Subscriptions

**This is the most common cause.**

You may have:
- Print+Digital subscription AND Digital-Only subscription
- Multiple subscriptions for different team members
- Subscriptions under different email addresses
- Subscriptions to different State Affairs publications (Arizona Capitol Times, State House News Service, etc.)

**Example from a Real Customer:**

Tyenesha at AMWUA contacted us because she was "charged six times but only received two newspapers." After investigation, we discovered:
- She had BOTH a Print+Digital subscription AND a Digital-Only subscription
- The system was charging for both each month
- Only ONE newspaper was being delivered (because she only had one print subscription)
- She thought she only had one subscription

**Solution:**
We cancelled the Digital-Only subscription, kept the Print+Digital, and wrote off the outstanding balance. Future billing = one charge per month.

**How to Check:**
Email billing@stateaffairs.com and ask: "Can you list all my active subscriptions?"

### 2. Autopay Catch-Up from System Migration

**What Happened:**

During our system migration, some autopay settings didn't carry over correctly. This meant:
- Your card wasn't being automatically charged for several months
- You were accumulating unpaid invoices
- Once the issue was fixed, the system collected all missed payments at once

**Example:**

One customer was charged 6 times in a single day because the system collected:
- December 2024 invoice: $28.43
- January 2025 invoice: $28.43
- February 2025 invoice: $28.43
- March 2025 invoice: $28.43
- April 2025 invoice: $28.43
- May 2025 invoice: $30.00
- **Total:** $174.15 in one day

**Why This Happens:**
- You HAD been receiving the service all along
- The charges were legitimate (you were using the service those months)
- The system just hadn't collected payment
- When the bug was fixed, it caught up all at once

**What We Do to Help:**
- Provide detailed invoice breakdown showing each charge
- Offer payment plans if the catch-up is a financial burden
- Explain the situation clearly
- Ensure it doesn't happen again

**How to Prevent:**
- If you notice you HAVEN'T been charged for a few months, contact us
- Don't assume the service is free - charges will catch up eventually
- Set up payment alerts on your credit card to notice missing charges

---

### 3. Duplicate Billing Due to Administrative Error

**Less Common But It Happens:**

Sometimes the same invoice gets charged twice due to:
- Processing error
- Duplicate account entries
- Manual billing mistake

**How to Identify:**
- Look for identical charges on the same day
- Check invoice numbers - are they duplicates?
- Compare service periods - are they identical?

**Solution:**
Contact billing@stateaffairs.com immediately with:
- Screenshot of the duplicate charges
- Invoice numbers
- Date of charges

We'll:
- Investigate immediately
- Refund duplicate charges within 3-5 business days
- Prevent it from happening again

---

### 4. Payment Reminder vs. New Invoice Confusion

**What Happened:**

You received an email that looked like an invoice, but it was actually a payment reminder for an already-sent invoice.

**Example:**

Quickbooks Payments contacted us thinking they received a new invoice. After investigation, we confirmed: "This is not a new invoice but rather, a payment reminder sent."

**How This Causes Confusion:**
- Payment reminders and new invoices can look similar
- If you pay the reminder thinking it's a new invoice, you might pay twice
- If you ignore it thinking it's a duplicate, your account becomes past due

**How to Tell the Difference:**

**Payment Reminder:**
- Subject line includes "Reminder" or "Past Due"
- References an existing invoice number
- States original invoice date
- Shows amount still owed

**New Invoice:**
- Subject line is "Your Invoice" or "New Invoice"
- Has a new invoice number
- Shows current date as invoice date
- Shows full amount (not "amount owed")

**What to Do:**
1. Check your records - have you already paid this invoice?
2. Look at the invoice number - is it familiar?
3. When in doubt, email billing@stateaffairs.com before paying

## Step-by-Step: What to Do If You Were Charged Multiple Times

### Step 1: Gather Information (5 minutes)

Collect:
- [ ] Credit card or bank statement showing the charges
- [ ] Dates of each charge
- [ ] Amount of each charge
- [ ] Any State Affairs emails you've received

Write down:
- How many times you were charged
- What you expected to be charged
- Whether this is the first time or a recurring issue

---

### Step 2: Contact Billing (Same Day)

**Email:** billing@stateaffairs.com

**Subject:** Multiple Charges on [Date]

**Include:**
```
Hi,

I was charged [NUMBER] times on [DATE] for State Affairs subscriptions. I expected to be charged [once/amount] but was charged [specific amounts].

Dates and amounts of charges:
- [Date]: $[Amount]
- [Date]: $[Amount]
- [Date]: $[Amount]

My organization: [NAME]
Email associated with account: [EMAIL]

Can you please investigate and explain these charges?

Thank you,
[Your Name]
```

### Step 3: Review Our Response (Within 24 Hours)

We'll send you:

**Detailed Invoice Breakdown** showing:
- Invoice number for each charge
- Service period covered (e.g., Jan 1-31, Feb 1-28)
- What subscription each charge relates to
- Explanation of why each charge occurred

**Example Breakdown:**

```
Invoice #2025014108 (Jan 19 - Feb 18, 2025) - $28.43
    Subscription: Arizona Capitol Times Print+Digital

Invoice #2025024892 (Feb 19 - Mar 18, 2025) - $28.43
    Subscription: Arizona Capitol Times Print+Digital

Invoice #2025034567 (Jan 19 - Feb 18, 2025) - $22.00
    Subscription: Arizona Capitol Times Digital-Only
```

This would show you have TWO subscriptions running simultaneously.

### Step 4: Decide What to Do

Based on our explanation, you'll need to decide:

**Option A: Keep Everything**
- All charges are legitimate
- You want all subscriptions
- Just wanted clarification

---

### Step 5: Follow-Up (Ongoing)

After resolution:

**If subscriptions were cancelled:**

  - Is it a duplicate?

  - Are you getting multiple per month?
  - Do amounts match?

  - Confirm charges match invoices

### 3. Monitor Autopay

- Set up credit card alerts for State Affairs charges
- Review statement each month

## Common Questions

### "Can I get a refund for the months I didn't know I had two subscriptions?"

**Short Answer:** Generally no, if you received the service.

**Long Answer:** If you had two subscriptions and they were both active (you were receiving newspapers and/or had digital access), those are legitimate charges even if you didn't realize you had two subscriptions. However, we WILL cancel the duplicate subscription immediately and write off any outstanding balance for future months.

### "Why didn't anyone tell me I had two subscriptions?"

**Honest Answer:** We're working on better systems to:
- Flag potential duplicates at sign-up
- Proactively notify customers of multiple subscriptions
- Make subscription management more self-service

Your feedback helps us improve these systems.

### "Can you refund my credit card today?"

**Timeline:** If a refund is approved:
- We process within 24 hours
- Credit appears in 3-5 business days
- Depends on your credit card company's processing time

### "I want to talk to a manager."

**Absolutely:** Email billing@stateaffairs.com and request management escalation. We'll connect you with our leadership team.
