# Billing & Invoice Issues

# Billing & Invoice Issues

## Overview
This guide helps you resolve common billing and invoice questions for State Affairs subscriptions.

## Common Billing Issues

### Double Billing or Unexpected Charges

**What happened?**
You may see multiple charges on your credit card or bank statement that you weren't expecting.

**Common Causes:**
1. **Multiple Subscriptions**: You may have both a print+digital subscription AND a digital-only subscription active
2. **System Migration**: During our system upgrade, some autopay settings needed to be reconfigured, resulting in missed payment collection
3. **Missed Invoice Catch-up**: If previous invoices weren't collected automatically, the system may catch up on multiple months at once

**How to Resolve:**

1. **Contact Support**: Email billing@stateaffairs.com with:
   - Description of the unexpected charges
   - Dates and amounts of the charges
   - Your account information

2. **Request Invoice Breakdown**: Ask for a detailed list showing:
   - Invoice numbers
   - Invoice dates and periods covered
   - Amount for each invoice
   - Which subscription each charge relates to

3. **Verify Your Subscriptions**: Confirm which subscriptions you actually want to keep:
   - Print + Digital subscription
   - Digital-only subscription
   - Number of copies you're receiving

**What We'll Do:**
- Provide detailed invoice history with receipts
- Identify if you have duplicate subscriptions
- Cancel any unwanted subscriptions
- Write off outstanding balances for cancelled subscriptions (no refund for previously collected payments)
- Update autopay settings to prevent future issues

### I Received an Invoice - Is This Correct?

**Quick Check:**
1. Verify the invoice is addressed to your organization
2. Check if you have an active subscription with us
3. Review the service period and amount

**Common Scenarios:**

**Scenario 1: Public Notice Invoice**
- These are for one-time legal notice publications
- Not related to subscription billing
- Sent to the entity requesting the publication

**Scenario 2: Payment Reminder**
- May be a reminder for an existing invoice, not a new charge
- Check your records to see if this invoice was already paid

**Scenario 3: Wrong Recipient**
- Invoice may have been sent to the wrong email address
- Contact billing@stateaffairs.com to clarify

### Autopay & Payment Issues

**Setting Up Autopay:**
- Autopay is the recommended payment method to avoid service interruption
- Your card will be charged automatically each billing period
- You'll receive invoices via email for your records

**Autopay Not Working:**
If you're enrolled in autopay but still receiving past due notices:
1. Contact support to verify your autopay status
2. We'll check if the payment method on file is valid
3. We'll update the system if needed

### Refund Requests

**Refund Policy:**
- If we collected payment for a cancelled subscription, we typically write off the outstanding balance rather than process refunds
- For specific refund requests, contact billing@stateaffairs.com with your situation

### Still Receiving Duplicate Copies

If you've cancelled a subscription but are still receiving multiple newspapers:
1. Email support@stateaffairs.com
2. Include your mailing address
3. Specify how many copies you're receiving vs. how many you should receive
4. We'll contact the printer to remove the duplicate mailing
