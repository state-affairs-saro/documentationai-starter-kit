## Analysis: What's MISSING from Support Tickets

Comparing the Scribe guides to the support ticket analysis reveals these guides cover **LEGISLATIVE TRACKING FEATURES** but are missing **BILLING & SUBSCRIPTION MANAGEMENT** topics that dominate support tickets.

### ❌ Critical Gaps (from support ticket analysis):

1. **Billing & Invoices** - NOT COVERED
   - Understanding invoices
   - Multiple subscriptions
   - Autopay management
   - Cancellation process
   - Refund policy

2. **Account Management** - MINIMAL COVERAGE
   - Requesting credentials (only mobile login covered)
   - Password resets
   - Email preferences
   - Notification settings

3. **Subscription Management** - NOT COVERED
   - Subscription types (Print, Digital, Print+Digital)
   - How to check active subscriptions
   - Upgrading/downgrading
   - Understanding charges

4. **General Support** - NOT COVERED
   - Who to contact for what
   - Response time expectations
   - How to get help

5. **Troubleshooting** - LIMITED
   - Login issues (only basic mobile login)
   - Technical problems
   - Browser compatibility
   - Feature bugs

## Key Insights

### Content Strategy Observations:

1. **Product-Focused:** Guides are 100% focused on platform features (bill tracking, calendars, reports)

2. **Recent Activity:** Most guides created in January 2026 (very fresh content!)

3. **Multiple Authors:** 
   - Savannah Gilman: 10+ guides (primary author)
   - Daniel Kelske: 6 guides
   - Andrew Roth: 2 guides
   - Ivan Silvagni: 1 guide

4. **Consistent Format:** All using Scribe's visual step-by-step format

5. **Master Guide Approach:** TLS User Guide serves as hub linking to specific guides

### Engagement Metrics:

**TLS User Guide:**
- 128 views in 23 days = ~5.6 views/day
- 32% completion rate (typical for longer guides)
- Indicates good engagement but room for improvement

### Use Case:

These guides appear to be:
- **Internal documentation** for customers using the legislative tracking platform
- **Onboarding materials** for new subscribers (especially TLS transition)
- **Feature documentation** for power users

They are **NOT:**
- General help center content
- Billing/subscription guides  
- Troubleshooting documentation
- Support contact information

## Integration Opportunities

### How to Integrate Scribe Guides with New Help Center:

1. **Create New Section:** "Platform Features & Tutorials"
   - Link to all 20 Scribe guides
   - Organized by category
   - Embedded or linked

2. **Complement with Missing Content:**
   - Use the 9 help documents we created for billing/subscription topics
   - Scribe guides handle "HOW to use features"
   - New help docs handle "HOW to manage account/billing"

3. **Unified Help Center Structure:**

```
