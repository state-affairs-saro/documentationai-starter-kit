## Screenshot Usage Guidelines

### When Creating New Screenshots:
1. **Consistent browser size:** Keep window dimensions similar for uniformity
2. **Clean data:** Use example/demo data, blur sensitive information if needed
3. **Full tab view:** Capture entire tab including navigation
4. **High resolution:** Minimum 1200px wide for clarity
5. **Relevant state:** Show the feature in use, not just empty states

### When Adding to Documentation:
1. **Place near relevant text:** Screenshot should appear close to the instruction it illustrates
2. **Add descriptive alt text:** For accessibility and SEO
3. **Include caption:** Briefly explain what users should notice
4. **Reference in text:** Call out key elements visible in the screenshot
