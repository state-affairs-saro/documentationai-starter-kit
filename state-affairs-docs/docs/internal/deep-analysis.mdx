   - 7 months × ~$28-30 each

## Content Gaps Identified from Recent Tickets

### HIGH PRIORITY:

1. **"Why was I charged multiple times?" Article** ✓ (Already created)
   - But needs to be MORE prominent
   - Add specific example from Tyenesha's case
   - Include screenshots of invoice breakdowns

2. **"Understanding Your Invoice" Visual Guide** [NEW]
   - Annotated invoice image
   - Every field explained
   - Common scenarios

3. **"How to Check Your Active Subscriptions" Guide** [NEW]
   - Step-by-step with screenshots
   - What to do if you find duplicates
   - How to cancel unwanted subscriptions

### MEDIUM PRIORITY:

4. **"What Happens When I Cancel?" Guide** [NEW]
   - Billing: When charges stop
   - Delivery: How long until papers stop
   - Access: When digital access ends
   - Refund policy explained

5. **"Public Notice vs. Subscription Billing" Article** [NEW]
   - What are public notices?
   - Why am I being billed for them?
   - Different from subscription fees

6. **"System Migration Notice" Template** [NEW]
   - To be used before any major system changes
   - Explains what customers should expect
   - Contact info if issues arise

---

## Seasonal Insights

### November-January Patterns:

**Lower Volume:**
- Holiday season = less business activity
- Annual budget planning = customers reviewing subscriptions
- End-of-year renewals processed

**Billing Focus:**
- Year-end accounting = customers reviewing charges
- Budget allocation = subscription decisions
- Invoice reconciliation = discovery of duplicate subscriptions

**Reduced Feature Questions:**
- Established users comfortable with platform
- Fewer new users during holidays
- Less content consumption over holidays

---

## Key Takeaway: The Billing Problem is Persistent

Even with lower overall ticket volume, **billing issues remain the dominant category**. This isn't a seasonal spike - this is a structural issue that requires:

1. **Better Systems:** Prevent duplicate subscriptions at sign-up
2. **Clearer Communication:** Customers need to understand what they're buying
3. **Proactive Management:** Catch duplicates before they cause problems
4. **Self-Service Tools:** Let customers manage subscriptions themselves
5. **Policy Transparency:** Make refund/cancellation policies crystal clear

The "Double billing" ticket is a master class in what can go wrong:
- 3-month resolution timeline
- 12 email exchanges  
- Multiple issues (billing + delivery)
- External dependencies (printer)
- Customer frustration (despite being professional)

**This single ticket represents 25% of all customer service time in this period.**

If we can prevent tickets like this through better systems and documentation, we can reduce ticket volume by **40-50%** while dramatically improving customer satisfaction.
