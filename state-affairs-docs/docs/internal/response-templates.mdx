Let me investigate this for you. To better assist you, could you please confirm:

### Template: Keyword Alerts Troubleshooting

**Subject:** Re: Keyword Alerts Issue

Hi [Customer Name],

Sorry to hear you're having trouble with your keyword alerts! I'm happy to help get this working for you.

[Choose appropriate response]:

**If keywords disappeared:**
This sometimes happens after system updates. Try logging out and back in, then navigate to the Alerts section. You should see the prompt to set up your keywords again.

**If stuck in loop:**
This can be a browser cache issue. Try clearing your cache or using a different browser. If that doesn't work, I can manually set up the keywords for you - just let me know which terms you'd like to track.

**If can't add keywords:**
I can add these manually for you. Just reply with the keywords or phrases you want alerts for, and I'll get them set up in your account right away.

Would you like me to set these up for you, or would you prefer to try the troubleshooting steps first?

Thanks,
[Your Name]
