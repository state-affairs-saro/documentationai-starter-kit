## Overview

Use this page as your starting point for anything related to State Affairs subscriptions: what you have, how to fix duplicates, and how invoices and autopay work.

You may have one or more of these subscription types:

- **Print + Digital:** Physical newspaper delivery, full digital access, mobile app, email alerts, and archive search. Commonly around \$28–\$30/month.
- **Digital-only:** Full digital access (no print delivery). Commonly around \$20–\$25/month.
- **Print-only:** Physical newspaper delivery only (no digital access). Less common; most customers choose Print + Digital for full access.

Some organizations also receive **one-time public notice invoices** in addition to subscription billing.

## Key policies at a glance

- **Multiple subscriptions:** It is possible to have more than one active subscription (for example, Print + Digital plus Digital-only, or subscriptions under different email addresses).
- **Non-refundable payments:** When duplicate or extra subscriptions are cancelled, previously collected payments are **non-refundable**, but future charges are stopped, and outstanding balances on cancelled subscriptions are written off.
- **Cancellation timing:** Cancellations are processed at the end of the current billing period. You keep access through the period you already paid for; there are no mid-period refunds.
- **Digital access after cancellation:** Digital access stays active until the end of the paid period, then your login is deactivated on the effective cancellation date.
- **Print delivery timing:** Print delivery may take 1–2 billing cycles to fully stop due to printer and mailing schedules. If you still receive newspapers after about 4 weeks, contact billing or support.
- **Autopay:** When autopay is on, each active subscription charges automatically each billing period. System migrations can occasionally result in catch-up charges for missed payments.
- **Public notice vs. subscriptions:** Public notice invoices are one-time legal advertising charges and are separate from recurring subscription billing.
