## When to use this guide

Use this guide if you:

- Are being charged twice and did not expect multiple subscriptions
- Are receiving extra print newspapers you do not need
- Manage subscriptions for multiple people in your organization
- Tried to cancel but are still being charged

For an overview of subscription types and self-service options, see [Subscription Management](/help-center/guides/subscription-management).  
To first confirm what is active on your account, go to the **Check Your Subscriptions** subpage in that guide.

## Common scenarios and what to do

<Expandable title="Scenario 1: Charged twice but only expected one subscription" default-open="true">

You may have:

- Signed up separately for Print+Digital and Digital-Only
- Another person created a second subscription for you
- Active subscriptions to multiple State Affairs publications

**What to do**

1. Email `billing@stateaffairs.com`.
2. Ask for a complete list of all subscriptions under your name, organization, and email.
3. Decide which subscription(s) you want to keep.
4. Confirm in writing which to keep and which to cancel.

Billing will cancel the extra subscriptions and prevent future billing on those accounts. Any outstanding balance on subscriptions that are cancelled as duplicates will be written off.

</Expandable>

<Expandable title="Scenario 2: Receiving two newspapers but only want one" default-open="false">

You may have:

- Two Print+Digital subscriptions
- A Print-Only subscription plus a Print+Digital subscription

**What to do**

1. Email `support@stateaffairs.com`.
2. Include:
   - Your full name
   - Your mailing address
   - How many copies you receive
   - How many copies you want to keep
3. Support will identify duplicate print deliveries, cancel the extras, and coordinate with the printer.

It may take 1–2 billing cycles for extra print deliveries to fully stop, due to printer schedules.

<Callout kind="info">

If you still receive extra print copies after 4 weeks, contact `support@stateaffairs.com` again so the team can follow up with the printer.

</Callout>

</Expandable>

<Expandable title="Scenario 3: Multiple people at your organization have subscriptions" default-open="false">

This is normal. Each person&apos;s subscription is independent and billed separately unless you have a group or enterprise plan.

**What to do**

- If separate billing is fine, you do not need to change anything.
- If you want consolidated billing or a group plan:
  - Contact your State Affairs account representative to review options.
  - You can also email `billing@stateaffairs.com` and ask to be connected with the right contact for group or enterprise plans.

</Expandable>

<Expandable title="Scenario 4: You cancelled but are still being charged" default-open="false">

This can happen if:

- Your cancellation was not processed before the next billing cycle, or
- You cancelled one subscription, but another is still active, or
- The cancellation email was not received or processed

**What to do**

1. Locate any cancellation confirmation email you received.
2. Forward it to `billing@stateaffairs.com`.
3. Include details for the charge you are asking about:
   - Charge date
   - Amount
   - Last 4 digits of the payment method, if available

Billing will:

- Verify the status of your subscription(s)
- Process an immediate cancellation if needed
- Determine whether a refund or account credit is appropriate

## How to cancel a subscription

Use these steps when you want to cancel one or more subscriptions.

<Steps>

<Step title="Identify which subscription you want to cancel">

Before you email billing, identify:

- The subscription type (for example, Digital-Only, Print+Digital, or Print-Only)
- The publication (for example, which State Affairs state or product)
- Whether you want to cancel all subscriptions, or keep some and cancel others

If you are not sure what is active, use the **Check Your Subscriptions** subpage linked from [Subscription Management](/help-center/guides/subscription-management) and review your recent invoices.

</Step>

<Step title="Email billing with required details">

Send an email to `billing@stateaffairs.com` with the subject line such as `Subscription cancellation request`.

Include all of the following in your message:

- Your full name
- Your organization name (if applicable)
- The email address associated with the subscription
- Which subscription(s) you want to cancel
- Which subscription(s) you want to keep, if you have more than one

</Step>

<Step title="Wait for confirmation and review details">

Billing will respond within 24–48 hours with:

- Confirmation that your request was received
- Which subscription(s) will be cancelled
- When the cancellation will take effect
- Whether there will be any final charge
- When your digital access will end
- When to expect print delivery to stop (if applicable)

Review the confirmation and keep it for your records.

</Step>

</Steps>

**Important cancellation policy**

- Cancellations are processed at the end of your current billing period.
- You will continue to have access until the end of the paid period.
- There are no mid-period refunds for time that has already been paid.
- For print subscriptions, delivery may take 1–2 billing cycles to fully stop due to printer schedules.
- If you still receive print deliveries after 4 weeks, contact support again so they can investigate.

Previously collected payments are non-refundable, except where billing determines a refund or credit is appropriate (for example, when a cancellation delay or duplicate subscription is confirmed).
