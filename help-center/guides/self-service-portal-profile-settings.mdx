## Overview

Use the **Profile Settings** tab in the self-service portal to control how State Affairs communicates with you and what you see when you first sign in. From here you can:

- View basic account information
- Manage email notifications for bill activity and keyword alerts
- Set daily digest delivery times
- Choose your default state
- Change your password

If you are looking for a general overview of the portal, see the main [Self-Service Portal guide](/help-center/guides/self-service-portal).

## Accessing profile settings

You can open profile settings in either of these ways:

1. Go to `https://pro.stateaffairs.com/settings/account` (if you are already signed in).
2. From within the portal, navigate to **Settings** and select the **Profile Settings** tab.

## Understanding the Profile Settings tab

The Profile Settings tab is organized into a few key areas:

- **Account information**: Your name, email, and other basic details.
- **Notifications**: Bill and keyword alerts, including real-time and digest options.
- **Default state**: Which state shows by default when you sign in.
- **Security**: Password change controls.

## Managing notifications

### Notification types

You can configure two separate types of notifications:

- **Bill Updates**: Changes or activity on bills you track.
- **Keywords**: Activity related to keywords you follow.

Each notification type has its own settings for:

- **Real-time alerts**
- **Daily digest delivery time**

### Real-time alerts

For each notification type, you can enable a **real-time** checkbox:

- When checked, you receive an email shortly after relevant activity occurs.
- When unchecked, you will only receive information through the daily digest (if enabled) or by checking the portal directly.

Use real-time alerts when you need immediate visibility into specific bills or topics.

### Daily digest delivery times

You can also select a **daily digest** time for each notification type. Available options are:

- `None`
- `6 AM EST`
- `12 PM EST`
- `6 PM EST`

When you choose a time, you receive a summary email around that hour with all recent activity for that notification type.

Recommended patterns:

- **One consolidated digest**: Set both *Bill Updates* and *Keywords* to the **same digest time** (for example, `12 PM EST`) to receive a single summary around midday.
- **Morning overview**: Use `6 AM EST` if you prefer to review activity at the start of your day.
- **No digest**: Select `None` if you only want real-time alerts or prefer to check updates inside the portal.

## Choosing your default state

The **Default state** dropdown controls which state appears first when you sign in to the portal.

- When you change this setting, the selected state becomes the primary view on your next login.
- You can still switch to other states after signing in; this setting only affects the initial view.

Use this setting to match the state you work with most often, so you land on the most relevant content by default.

## Changing your password

Use **Change password** in Profile Settings to update your password without signing out first.

  <Step title="Meet password requirements" icon="check-circle">

  - Your new password must be **at least 8 characters** long.
  - For stronger security, use a mix of:
    - Uppercase and lowercase letters
    - Numbers
    - Symbols (where allowed)

  </Step>
  <Step title="Save and sign back in" icon="arrow-right">

  - Select **Save** or **Update password**.
  - You will be **logged out** after the change for security.
  - Sign back in using your **new password**.

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout kind="tip">

If you **forget** your password and cannot sign in, use the **Forgot Password** link on the login screen to reset it. You do not need access to the Profile Settings page for this.

## Common tasks

### Reduce the number of emails you receive

To cut down on email volume:

1. Go to **Profile Settings**.
2. Under **Bill Updates** and **Keywords**:
   - Uncheck **real-time** if you do not need immediate alerts.
   - Set the **daily digest** for each to a single time (for example, `12 PM EST`).
3. If you still receive more than you want, switch one or both digests to `None`.

### Enable immediate alerts for critical activity

To be notified right away:

1. Go to **Profile Settings**.
2. Under **Bill Updates** and/or **Keywords**, check the **real-time** box.
3. Optionally keep a **daily digest** enabled for an at-a-glance summary later in the day.

### Change your daily digest time

To shift when summaries arrive:

1. Go to **Profile Settings**.
2. For **Bill Updates** and **Keywords**, open the **daily digest** dropdown.
3. Choose `6 AM EST`, `12 PM EST`, or `6 PM EST`.
4. Use the same time for both types if you want a single combined summary window.

### Set or update your default state

1. Go to **Profile Settings**.
2. Find the **Default state** dropdown.
3. Select the state you work with most often.
4. Your new default takes effect the next time you sign in.
