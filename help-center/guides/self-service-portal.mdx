## Overview

The State Affairs self-service portal lets you manage your account, subscriptions, team members, and preferences without needing to contact support.

You can access the portal anytime from your profile menu in the app:

- **Portal URL:** https://pro.stateaffairs.com/settings/account

The portal is organized into four main sections:

1. **Account Overview** – Billing, invoices, and subscription management  
2. **Team Members** – User access, roles, and seat assignment  
3. **Profile Settings** – Notifications, default state, and password  
4. **Label Settings** – Custom labels to organize bills
