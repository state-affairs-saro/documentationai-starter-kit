## Overview

Label Settings in the Self-Service Portal let you define and manage the labels your team uses to organize bills. Labels are custom tags you apply to bills to make them easier to find, sort, and report on.

Common examples include:

- `Priority Bills`
- `Education Issues`
- `Budget Impact`
- `Key Stakeholders`
- `Internal Review`

You configure labels in **Label Settings**, then apply them on individual bills or from bill lists.

This article focuses on the Label Settings page only. For a full Self-Service Portal overview, see [Self-Service Portal](/help-center/guides/self-service-portal).

## What you can do in Label Settings

On the Label Settings page, you can:

- **Create new labels** using the `+ Add Label` button.
- **View all existing labels** in a single list.
- **See how often each label is used**, including:
  - How many bills are tagged with the label.
  - Which team members have used that label.
- **Search labels** using the search box to quickly find a specific label.
- **Reorder labels** by turning on **Reorder Mode** and dragging labels into the order you prefer.
- **Delete labels** you no longer want to use.

A typical Label Settings screen will show:

- A **search box** at the top.
- A **Reorder Mode** toggle.
- A **`+ Add Label`** button.
- A table or list of all labels, including counts and basic usage information.

## Creating a new label

Use Label Settings to define labels before your team starts tagging bills.

<Steps>

  <Step title="Open Label Settings" icon="settings">

  1. Sign in to the Self-Service Portal.
  2. Go to the **Label Settings** section from the main navigation or settings menu.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Start a new label" icon="plus">

  1. In Label Settings, select **`+ Add Label`**.
  2. A form or dialog to define the label opens.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure label details" icon="edit">

  In the label form, provide:

  - **Name** (required): A short, clear label name, such as `High Priority` or `Budget Impact`.
  - **Color** (if available): Choose a color to visually distinguish the label in bill lists and details.
  - **Description** (optional): Add context so teammates know when and how to use the label.

  Review the information, then select **Save** to create the label.

  </Step>

</Steps>

After saving, the label appears in the Label Settings list and is available to apply on bills across the portal.

## How labels are used on bills

Once labels are defined in Label Settings, your team applies them directly on bills.

### From an individual bill page

On a bill&apos;s detail page, look for the **Labels** section. There you can:

- Add one or more existing labels to the bill.
- Remove labels that no longer apply.

Changes save to that bill and immediately update label usage counts in Label Settings.

### From bill lists

When you need to label multiple bills at once:

1. Open the relevant bill list or search results.
2. Select the bills you want to update.
3. Choose **Add Label** (or similar label action) from the bulk actions menu.
4. Pick one or more existing labels and apply them.

This bulk action is the fastest way to roll out new label strategies, such as tagging all active `Budget Impact` bills.

<Callout kind="tip">

Label Settings controls which labels are available. Applying labels always happens on bill pages or bill lists, not inside Label Settings.

## Best practices for label design

Well-designed labels make bill tracking faster and more consistent for your team.

### Keep the list focused

Try to maintain **5–10 core labels** that your team uses regularly. Too many labels can:

- Overwhelm new users.
- Make it harder to choose the right label.
- Lead to inconsistent tagging.

If you find many low-usage labels, consider consolidating or retiring them.

### Common label strategies

You can mix and match these strategies, but keep the total number manageable.

- **Priority-based labels**  
  Indicate how urgent or important a bill is.
  - Examples: `High Priority`, `Medium Priority`, `Low Priority`.

- **Issue-based labels**  
  Group bills by policy area or topic.
  - Examples: `Education Issues`, `Healthcare`, `Environment`, `Tax Policy`.

- **Action-based labels**  
  Reflect the next step or status for internal workflows.
  - Examples: `Needs Review`, `For Leadership Briefing`, `Ready for Outreach`.

- **Position-based labels**  
  Capture your organization&apos;s stance or interest.
  - Examples: `Support`, `Oppose`, `Monitor`.

- **Team-based labels**  
  Show which group, office, or staff member is responsible.
  - Examples: `Government Affairs`, `Legal`, `Communications`.

### Naming conventions

Consistent naming helps labels sort and scan better. Consider:

- **Prefixes** to group related labels together:
  - `P: High`, `P: Medium`, `P: Low` for priority.
  - `T: Education`, `T: Healthcare` for topic.
- **Short, descriptive names** that fit easily in lists.
- Avoiding duplicates or near-duplicates, such as `High Priority` and `Urgent` used in the same way.

Review Label Settings periodically to clean up unused labels and keep the list aligned with how your team actually works.

## Reordering labels

The order of labels affects how they appear in dropdowns and bill pages. You can reorder labels from Label Settings.

<Steps>

  <Step title="Enable Reorder Mode" icon="arrow-right">

  1. Go to **Label Settings**.
  2. Toggle **Reorder Mode** on.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Drag labels into the right order" icon="folder">

  1. Click and hold the handle or row of the label you want to move.
  2. Drag it to its new position in the list.
  3. Repeat for any labels you want to reorder.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Turn off Reorder Mode" icon="check-circle">

  When you are done, toggle **Reorder Mode** off to prevent accidental changes. The new order will be used anywhere labels appear in the Self-Service Portal.

  </Step>

</Steps>

## Deleting labels safely

You can delete labels in Label Settings when they are no longer needed.

Typical steps:

1. Open **Label Settings**.
2. Find the label you want to remove (use the search box if needed).
3. Select the delete option for that label.
4. Confirm the deletion when prompted.

<Callout kind="danger">

**Important:** Deleting a label removes it from **all bills** where it was applied. This cannot be undone from Label Settings.

</Callout>

To avoid losing historical context:

- Consider **renaming** the label first, for example from `Budget Impact` to `OLD - Budget Impact`, and stop using it on new bills.
- After you have transitioned off the label and no longer need past tagging, you can delete it.

## Viewing bills by label

Label Settings show how many bills use each label, but they do **not** provide detailed bill lists.

To view all bills with a specific label:

1. Go to the **Bill Tracking** section of the Self-Service Portal.
2. Use the filters to select the label you want to review.
3. Apply the filter to see the full list of bills tagged with that label.

Use this flow to:

- Audit how consistently a label is used.
- Review all `High Priority` or `Support` bills.
- Prepare reports or briefings based on labeled bills.
