## Quick self-check: do you have multiple subscriptions?

You may have more than one active subscription if any of the following apply:

- You are charged more than once per month
- You receive two or more newspapers
- Your charges do not match what you expect (for example, you expected $28 but are charged $56)
- You may have signed up with different email addresses

Use the steps below to confirm how many subscriptions are active and what each one includes.

<Callout kind="tip">

Before you start, make a short list of every email address you or your organization might have used to sign up. This will make searching and contacting Billing faster.

</Callout>

## Option 1: Check your email invoices

Use this option if you have access to the inboxes used for sign-up.

<Steps>

<Step title="Search for your invoices" icon="search">

In each inbox that might have a subscription:

- Open your email client
- Search for the terms `State Affairs` and `invoice`
- Filter to the last few months if your email tool supports it

</Step>

<Step title="Count your subscriptions" icon="bar-chart">

From your search results:

- Count how many different subscription invoices you receive each month
- Open each invoice and look for:
  - Subscription type (Print + Digital, Digital-Only, or Print-Only)
  - Monthly cost

</Step>

<Step title="Match charges to types" icon="check-circle">

Use the cost ranges and inclusions above to confirm:

- Which subscriptions are Print + Digital (about $28–30 per month)
- Which subscriptions are Digital-Only (about $20–25 per month)
- Which, if any, are Print-Only

</Step>

</Steps>

If invoices are unclear or you are still not sure how many subscriptions you have, use Option 2 and contact Billing.

## Option 2: Contact Billing to confirm subscriptions

If you cannot tell how many subscriptions you have, or you suspect duplicate charges, Billing can verify this for you.
