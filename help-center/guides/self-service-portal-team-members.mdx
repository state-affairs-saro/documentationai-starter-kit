## Common tasks

### Invite a new team member

1. Open the **Team Members** tab.
2. Select **+ Invite Member**.
3. Enter the user's **email** and **name**.
4. Choose their **role**: Admin or Member.
5. Select a **Seat Type** (a subscription seat must be available).
6. Click **Send invitation**.

<Callout kind="info">

- Invitations expire after **7 days** if not accepted.
- You must have an **available seat** to send an invitation.
- You can resend an invitation from the Actions menu while it is still pending.

</Callout>

### Change a user's role

1. Find the user in the **Team Members** table.
2. In the **Role** dropdown for that user, choose **Admin** or **Member**.
3. Confirm the change if prompted.

Use this to promote a Member to Admin or limit an Admin to Member access.

### Assign or reassign a seat

1. Find the user you want to update.
2. In the **Seat Type** dropdown, select the appropriate seat.
3. If needed, first free a seat by deactivating another user (see below).

Changing the seat type updates how that user consumes your subscription.

### Deactivate a user

Deactivating a user removes their access and frees their seat for someone else.

1. Find the user in the **Team Members** table.
2. Open the **Actions** menu for that user.
3. Select **Deactivate**.
4. Confirm the action.

The user moves from **Active** to **Inactive**, and their seat becomes available.

### Reactivate a user

You can restore access to a previously deactivated user.

1. Switch the view or filter to show **Inactive** users.
2. Find the user you want to restore.
3. Open the **Actions** menu.
4. Select **Reactivate**.
5. Assign a **Seat Type** if prompted (you must have an available seat).

The user returns to the **Active** list and regains access.

### Search for a team member

1. Go to the **Team Members** tab.
2. Use the **search bar** at the top of the table.
3. Type the user's **name** or **email**.

The table filters to show only matching records, across both Active and, depending on your filters, Inactive users.

## Important notes

<Callout kind="alert">

- You must have an **available seat** to:
  
  - Invite a new team member  
  - Reactivate a deactivated user  
  - Assign a seat to an existing user

- **Deactivating** a user immediately **frees up their seat**.
- **Invitations expire after 7 days** if not accepted; you can resend while they are pending.

</Callout>

If you still cannot add or manage users after following these steps, contact your account Admin or support through the in-app help channel.
