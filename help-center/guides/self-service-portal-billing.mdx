## Key concepts

### What is a seat?

A **seat** is an individual license that gives a person access to State Affairs in one or more states.

On the **Seats** table, you will see columns such as:

- **Seat type** (for example, News, Pro, Enterprise)
- **State**
- **Seats** (how many are assigned under that combination)
- **Action** (including a **Reassign Seats** option)

Reassigning seats lets you move access from one person to another. Detailed user and role management is covered in the Team Members page, but you can use **Reassign Seats** here when you simply need to move an existing license.

### Subscription and pricing tiers

Under your subscription details, you may see tiers such as:

- **News** from approximately **$600 per seat**
- **Pro** around **$2,250 per seat**
- **Enterprise** with custom pricing

You will also see your **subscription period dates**, which indicate the start and end dates of your current term.

## Common billing and seat tasks

### 1. Check your next invoice and amount due

1. Go to **https://pro.stateaffairs.com/settings/account**.
2. Make sure you are on the **Account Overview** tab.
3. Look for the **Next invoice** alert box.

This box shows:

- The **date** your next invoice will be issued.
- The **total amount due** for that invoice.

If there is a balance due, you can:

- Click **View Past Invoices** to see what is outstanding.
- Use the **Payment Portal** link to pay.
- Contact **billing@stateaffairs.com** if something looks incorrect.

### 2. View and download past invoices

1. From **Account Overview**, select the section labeled **Invoices** or click **View Past Invoices**.
2. Review the list of past invoices, which typically includes:
   - **Invoice number**
   - **Date issued**
   - **Amount**
   - **Payment status**
3. Click the **PDF download** option on any invoice you need for your records or for your finance team.

### 3. Update your payment method and billing details

To change your credit card, billing email, or billing address, use the external **Payment Portal**.

1. In **Account Overview**, find your **subscription information** section.
2. Click the **Payment Portal** link.
3. In the Payment Portal (managed by **Stripe**), you can:
   - Update your **credit card** or other payment method
   - Update your **billing email** and **billing address**
   - Review your **payment history**
   - Download **receipts**

If the Payment Portal does not load or you cannot update your details, email **billing@stateaffairs.com**.

### 4. See which states and seats you have access to

1. In **Account Overview**, find the **Seats** table.
2. Review each row to see:
   - **Seat type** (for example, News, Pro, Enterprise)
   - **State**
   - **Number of seats**

This gives you a quick view of which states you currently have coverage for and how many people can access each.

### 5. Reassign existing seats

If someone leaves your organization or changes roles, you can reassign a seat instead of purchasing a new one.

1. In the **Seats** table on **Account Overview**, find the seat type and state you want to change.
2. Click **Reassign Seats** for that row.
3. Follow the prompts to move an existing license to another team member.

The detailed process for adding or removing team members is covered in the Team Members documentation, but you can start the reassignment from this table.

### 6. Request additional seats or upgrades

You can request more seats or state coverage directly from the portal.

There are two main options:

- **Request seat under tiers**:
  - Use the **Request Seat** option under the relevant tier (for example, News, Pro, Enterprise).
  - Pricing examples:
    - News from **$600 per seat**
    - Pro around **$2,250 per seat**
    - Enterprise with custom pricing
- **Add seat/state**:
  - Use the general **Add seat/state** request if you want to expand into additional states or add more users.

Requests are typically reviewed and processed within **24 hours**. You will be notified about any changes to your subscription or billing.

If you want to upgrade from **News to Pro**, you can use the same request options or contact **billing@stateaffairs.com** for guidance.
