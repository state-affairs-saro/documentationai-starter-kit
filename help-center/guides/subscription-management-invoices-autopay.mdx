## Overview

This guide helps you quickly read an invoice, understand how autopay works, and know when to contact Billing to avoid unexpected charges.

If you need broader subscription context, see [Subscription Management](/help-center/guides/subscription-management).

## Understanding your invoice

Start by confirming these core fields on every invoice.

<Columns cols={2}>

<Card title="Invoice number" href="/help-center/guides/billing-issues" icon="file-text">

The invoice number is a unique identifier, usually in the format `Year + Number` (for example, `2025067432`). Use this number when you contact Billing about a specific charge.

</Card>

<Card title="Service period" href="/help-center/guides/billing-issues" icon="calendar">

The service period shows the exact dates you are being charged for, such as `Jun. 19, 2025 - Jul. 18, 2025`. Check that this matches when you expect your subscription to be active.

</Card>

</Columns>

<Columns cols={2}>

<Card title="Subscription type" href="/help-center/guides/subscription-management" icon="book-open">

The subscription type states whether the invoice is for Print, Digital, or Print+Digital service. If the type is not clearly stated, contact Billing for clarification before paying.

</Card>

<Card title="Amount due" href="/help-center/guides/billing-issues" icon="bar-chart">

The amount should match the tier you expect to pay. Changes may occur because of annual price increases or changes you made to your subscription. Review any changes before approving payment.

When you email Billing, include your organization name, the invoice number (if available), and a brief description of your question or concern. This helps Billing resolve issues faster.

## Red flags to watch for

Use this checklist to spot potential issues early.

- Multiple invoices issued on the same day: this may indicate multiple active subscriptions.
- An unexpected amount: this can be caused by multiple subscriptions under your account, catch-up billing for previously missed payments, or an annual price increase you should have been notified about.
- Service periods that do not match your expected dates, or that overlap across invoices: contact Billing before paying.
- Invoices for publications you do not subscribe to: these may be public notice invoices (one-time charges) or may indicate another subscription on your account.

<Callout kind="alert">

If any of these red flags appear, pause before paying and contact Billing at `billing@stateaffairs.com` so they can review your account.

## Autopay and subscription management

Autopay can simplify billing, but you should understand how it behaves across subscriptions.

### How autopay works

- You provide a payment method to Billing.
- Your card is charged automatically each billing period.
- You receive an invoice email each time a charge is processed.
- This repeats every month (or your set billing period) for each subscription on autopay.

### Benefits of autopay

- You never miss a payment.
- Your access remains uninterrupted.
- You avoid manual check or card payments each cycle.

### Common autopay issues

- If you have multiple subscriptions, each one may charge automatically, resulting in several charges in the same period.
- System migrations can trigger catch-up charges if earlier periods were not billed correctly.
- If your card expires or is declined, payments will fail and service may be interrupted.

<Callout kind="alert">

If you see surprise catch-up charges after a system change or migration, contact Billing at `billing@stateaffairs.com` right away. Billing can review the charges with you and, when appropriate, help set up payment plans.

</Callout>

### Updating or disabling autopay

To manage your payment method or autopay status:

- **Update payment method:** Email `billing@stateaffairs.com`. Billing will guide you through a secure way to update your card or other payment details.
- **Disable autopay:** Email `billing@stateaffairs.com` to request that autopay be turned off. You will receive manual invoices and must pay them on time to avoid service interruptions.

<Callout kind="tip">

For your security, never email your full credit card details. Use the secure update options Billing provides after you contact them.
