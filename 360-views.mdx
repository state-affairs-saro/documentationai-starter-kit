### What 360 Views are

360 Views is State Affairs&apos; advanced AI feature that creates comprehensive legislative intelligence reports based on your natural language questions. Instead of manually searching through bills, hearings, and news across multiple states, you can ask questions in plain English and receive a complete analysis with visualizations, bill recommendations, legislator insights, and related news.

**Think of it as:** Your AI research assistant that instantly analyzes legislative activity across all 50 states.

### What you put in (inputs)

You provide:

- A natural language prompt describing your topic or question
- Optional timeframes (for example, &quot;this month&quot;, &quot;last 90 days&quot;)
- Optional geographic focus (for example, &quot;across different states&quot;, &quot;in the Northeast&quot;)

**Example prompts:**

- &quot;Show me bills related to the regulation and taxation of ready-to-drink alcoholic beverages across different states.&quot;
- &quot;Summarize hearings on franchise-fee structures this month.&quot;
- &quot;Identify recent legislative proposals addressing AI governance.&quot;

## When to use 360 Views

Use 360 Views when you need:

- **Comprehensive topic research** across all 50 states
- **Multi-state comparison** of approaches and activity
- **AI analysis and synthesis** instead of manual scanning
- **Quick input** (a single prompt) with rich, structured output
- **Material for reports or presentations** on legislative topics
- **Strategic planning** around timing, trends, and key actors

Consider other features instead when you need:

- **Bill Tracking** – Following a specific bill&apos;s progress
- **Keyword Alerts** – Real-time notifications on specific terms
- **Dashboard** – A daily overview of recent legislative activity

## Create a 360 View

<Steps>

<Step title="Open 360 Views" icon="monitor">

- Go to the 360 Views section from your main navigation.
- The 360 Views interface displays with a prompt input box.

</Step>

<Step title="Enter your prompt" icon="terminal">

Type your question or research topic. Be as specific as possible about policy area, geography, and timeframe.

**Examples:**

- &quot;Show me bills related to [topic] across different states&quot;
- &quot;Analyze trends in [policy area] legislation&quot;
- &quot;Summarize hearings on [issue] this month&quot;
- &quot;Identify recent proposals addressing [topic]&quot;

</Step>

<Step title="Generate the view" icon="play-circle">

- Select any relevant filters such as date range or states if available.
- Select the option to generate the 360 View.
- The AI analyzes:

  - Bills across all 50 states
  - Recent hearings
  - News articles
  - Legislator activity
  - Trending topics

Typical processing time is 10–30 seconds, depending on prompt complexity.

</Step>

<Step title="Review and refine" icon="edit">

- Scan the AI summary and visualizations.
- If needed, refine your prompt (for example, narrower timeframe or more specific policy angle) and generate a new 360 View.
- All views are saved automatically so you can compare over time.

</Step>

</Steps>

## Understand your results

Once generated, a 360 View is organized into several sections so you can move from big picture to detail.

### AI summary

The AI-generated summary (top left) provides:

- State-level analysis
- Regulatory trends
- Key themes and patterns

Read this first for a high-level understanding before drilling into specific bills or states.

### Interactive heat map

The heat map (center) shows where the most activity is happening.

- **Visual intensity:** Darker blue indicates more activity.
- **Filters:** Toggle views for bills, hearings, and news.
- **Interaction:** Select a state on the map to see state-specific details.

Use the map for quick identification of hot spots and gaps in activity.

### Recommended bills

The bills section highlights the most relevant legislation for your topic, typically with status-based organization and progress indicators.

- Bills are grouped by status such as Introduced, Chamber, Passed, and Failed.
- Progress indicators help you quickly see how far bills have moved.
- Select &quot;View all&quot; (where available) to explore the full list and drill into individual bills.

This section is ideal for building or updating bill lists for tracking.

### Legislator intelligence

See which lawmakers are most active on your topic:

- State and party affiliation (D/R badges)
- Number of relevant bills sponsored
- Positions inferred by AI based on bill activity

Use this view to understand key champions, opponents, and influential actors for your issues.

### Featured hearings and schedules

The hearings section focuses on upcoming committee meetings and discussions relevant to your topic.

- Featured hearings with dates, committees, and state visuals
- Upcoming hearing schedules organized by state

This helps you identify near-term advocacy, testimony, and monitoring opportunities.

### Related news

The news section surfaces recent developments connected to your topic.

- Recent articles with headlines, images, and dates
- Links out to read full stories

Use this to enrich your understanding and reporting with context beyond legislative text.

### State details sidebar

The state sidebar provides a focused view for any selected state:

- Bills specific to that state
- Upcoming hearings
- Recent news
- Compact state-level summary of activity

Select states from the heat map to pivot between big-picture trends and local details.

## Prompt best practices

### Write effective prompts

#### Do

- Be specific: &quot;regulation of ready-to-drink alcoholic beverages&quot;
- Include timeframes: &quot;this month&quot;, &quot;last 90 days&quot;
- Specify geography: &quot;across different states&quot; or &quot;in the Northeast&quot;
- Mention aspects: &quot;taxation&quot;, &quot;licensing&quot;, &quot;distribution&quot;

#### Avoid

- Being too broad: &quot;alcohol laws&quot;
- Leaving out context: just &quot;beverages&quot;
- Using jargon without explanation

<Callout kind="tip">

If your results look too broad or noisy, narrow either the **topic** (for example, a single policy mechanism) or the **timeframe**, and regenerate the 360 View.

</Callout>

### Name and organize your views

Give each 360 View a clear, descriptive name so you can find and compare it later.

**Example names:**

- &quot;Ready-to-Drink Alcohol Laws – Q1 2026&quot;
- &quot;Data Center Taxation – January 2026&quot;
- &quot;AI Governance Bills – Winter 2026&quot;

Use a consistent naming pattern across your team (for example, `[Topic] – [Region] – [Time period]`) so your saved views form a usable knowledge base over time.

### Build a topic history

- Create recurring 360 Views on your key topics (for example, monthly or quarterly).
- Compare how legislation evolves across time periods.
- Look for recurring themes and differences across states.
