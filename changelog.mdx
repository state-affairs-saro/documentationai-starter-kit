## Overview

This page is the canonical log of product releases. Use it to summarize what changed in each version so readers can quickly see what was added, changed, or fixed.

When you publish a new release, add an entry below using the provided templates.

<Callout kind="info">

This is a placeholder changelog. Update this page as you ship new versions. Do not forget to keep the [Introduction](/introduction) and [Features](/features) pages aligned with any major changes.

</Callout>

## How to add a new release entry

Use the `<Update>` component for each release. Each update should include:

- A **label** (typically the release date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format)
- A **description** (usually the version number or a short title)
- Optional **tags** (for example: `breaking`, `feature`, `bugfix`, `security`, `improvement`)

Below is a commented example you can copy and adapt when you publish a new release.

<Update label="2025-01-01" description="v1.0.0" tags={["feature", "improvement"]}>

### Added

- Initial public release of the product.
- Document the main user flows on the [Introduction](/introduction) page.
- Highlight key capabilities on the [Features](/features) page.

### Changed

- Describe significant behavior changes here.
- Note any updates to configuration defaults or UI changes.

### Fixed

- List resolved bugs or reliability improvements.
- Reference any known issues that are now closed.

</Update>

## Template for future releases

Use this skeleton as a starting point when creating a real entry. Replace the placeholder values and remove any sections that do not apply.

```mdx
<Update label="YYYY-MM-DD" description="vX.Y.Z" tags={["feature", "bugfix"]}>

### Added

- Short, action-focused bullet describing a new feature.
- Link to updated docs, for example: [Introduction](/introduction) or [Features](/features).

### Changed

- Note any behavior or UX changes users should be aware of.
- Mention if configuration or API defaults were modified.

### Fixed

- Summarize bugs or regressions that were addressed.
- Include any performance or stability improvements.

</Update>
```

<Callout kind="tip">

Keep entries concise and user-focused. Aim to answer: *What do I need to know or do differently after this release?*

</Callout>

## Organizing entries over time

You can group releases by **version** or by **time period**, depending on your release cadence.

### Option 1: Version-based

Use one `<Update>` per tagged version (for example, `v1.1.0`, `v1.2.0`):

- Works well when you publish discrete, named releases.
- Makes it easy to link from other docs directly to a specific version entry.

### Option 2: Month-based

Use one section per month and include one or more `<Update>` components inside:

```mdx
## January 2025

<Update label="2025-01-10" description="Improvements and fixes" tags={["improvement", "bugfix"]}>

### Added

- Placeholder item.

### Changed

- Placeholder item.

### Fixed

- Placeholder item.

</Update>
```

Choose one structure and keep it consistent so readers can scan the history quickly.
